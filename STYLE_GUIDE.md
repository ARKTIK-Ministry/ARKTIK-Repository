# **ARKTIK Style Guide**

---

## **Purpose**
This style guide ensures that all ARKTIK projects maintain consistency, elegance, and alignment with our hybrid approach to development. By integrating the best practices for TypeScript, Mojo, and Rust, we create a foundation of excellence that reflects ARKTIK’s vision.

---

## **Code Formatting Standards**

### **1. General Guidelines**
- Write code that is clear, maintainable, and expressive.
- Avoid hardcoding values—use constants or environment variables.
- Prioritize modularity by breaking down functionality into reusable components or functions.

### **2. Indentation**
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation across all languages.
- Avoid tabs to maintain consistency.

### **3. Line Length**
- Limit line length to **100 characters** to ensure readability.

### **4. Comments**
- Focus on explaining **why** a decision was made rather than what the code does.
- Use the following styles:
  - **TypeScript**:  
    ```typescript
    // This comment explains the purpose of the function
    ```
  - **Rust**:  
    ```rust
    // Single-line comment for logic explanation
    ```
  - **Mojo**:  
    ```python
    """
    Multi-line comment explaining the context or logic.
    """
    ```

---

## **File and Directory Structure**
Organize projects into logical directories to ensure maintainability and scalability. Example:

arktik-project/ ├── frontend/ # TypeScript (React/Next.js) ├── ai/ # Mojo projects ├── blockchain/ # Rust projects ├── common/ # Shared utilities ├── infrastructure/ # Docker, CI/CD pipelines └── README.md


Each directory must contain a `README.md` explaining its purpose.

---

## **Naming Conventions**

### **1. Variables and Functions**
- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names:
  - Example: `calculateTransactionFee()`.

### **2. Classes and Components**
- Use `PascalCase` for class and component names:
  - Example: `TransactionManager`.

### **3. Constants**
- Use `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants:
  - Example: `MAX_ALLOWED_RETRIES`.

### **4. Filenames**
- Use `kebab-case` for filenames:
  - Example: `transaction-manager.ts`.

---

## **Language-Specific Standards**

### **1. TypeScript**
- Use strict typing in all projects (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`).
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code to improve readability.
- Organize components and utilities into distinct folders.

### **2. Mojo**
- Focus on leveraging Mojo’s strengths for high-performance AI/ML pipelines.
- Use Pythonic naming conventions (`snake_case`) for internal variables.
- Optimize computation-heavy sections for hardware acceleration.

### **3. Rust**
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting and `Clippy` for linting.
- Leverage Rust’s safety features to prevent memory leaks and runtime errors.
- Write modular, testable code by organizing functionality into crates.

---

## **Best Practices**

### **1. Code Reviews**
- All code must undergo peer review before merging.
- Reviewers should focus on:
  - Code clarity and adherence to the style guide.
  - Security vulnerabilities, especially in blockchain and AI projects.

### **2. Documentation**
- Use docstrings for public-facing functions and classes.
- Maintain detailed API documentation for TypeScript and Rust projects.

### **3. Error Handling**
- **TypeScript**: Use `try/catch` blocks and handle errors gracefully.
- **Rust**: Use `Result` and `Option` enums for safe error handling.
- **Mojo**: Log errors clearly for debugging during AI pipeline execution.

### **4. Testing**
- Write unit and integration tests for all critical functionality.
- Testing tools:
  - **TypeScript**: Jest or Playwright.
  - **Rust**: Built-in testing framework.
  - **Mojo**: Modular’s recommended testing tools.

---

## **Version Control Standards**
- Use **Git** for version control and GitHub for collaboration.
- Follow a structured branching strategy:
  - `main`: Production-ready code.
  - `dev`: Integration and staging.
  - `feature/*`: New features.
- Commit messages must follow this format:
  - `[Type]: Description`
  - Example: `[Feature]: Add user authentication`.

---

## **Collaboration and Communication**
- Maintain professionalism in all communications.
- Use GitHub Discussions for knowledge sharing and problem-solving.
- Respond promptly to feedback or comments.

---

## **Final Note**
This style guide is a living document and will evolve alongside ARKTIK’s ecosystem. Consistency, attention to detail, and adherence to these standards ensure ARKTIK remains a beacon of innovation and luxury in technology.
