# **Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) Overview**

### **Introduction**
The Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh, is one of the foundational texts of the Abrahamic faiths. It is composed of three major sections: the Torah (Law), the Nevi'im (Prophets), and the Ketuvim (Writings). These sacred scriptures form the bedrock of Jewish tradition and have deeply influenced Christianity and Islam.

At ARKTIK, we provide tools and resources to help you explore the Hebrew Bible’s timeless wisdom, rich narratives, and profound teachings. Whether you're new to the text or looking to deepen your understanding, the ARKTIK Sacred Texts Repository is your companion in this journey.
