## **Core Principles**

### **1. Respect Above All**
   - Treat all participants, their beliefs, and traditions with the utmost respect.
   - Avoid offensive language, interruptions, or dismissive attitudes.
   - Respect the sanctity of sacred practices, texts, and symbols.

### **2. Listen to Understand**
   - Approach each conversation with humility and a genuine desire to learn.
   - Focus on understanding different perspectives rather than debating or persuading.
   - Practice active listening: pause, reflect, and then respond thoughtfully.

### **3. Build Bridges, Not Walls**
   - Seek common values and shared principles across faiths and cultures.
   - Emphasize connections rather than differences.
   - Foster collaboration toward mutual goals like community service and social impact.

## **Participation Guidelines**

### **For Observers**

### **For Active Participants**
   - Speak authentically about your experiences and beliefs without diminishing others.
   - Refrain from proselytizing or using the platform for recruitment.
   - Engage with kindness, even in moments of disagreement.

### **For Facilitators**
   - Ensure all participants feel heard, respected, and valued.
   - Guide the discussion to remain on topic and aligned with ARKTIK’s mission.
   - Address any disrespectful conduct immediately and in accordance with ARKTIK’s zero-tolerance policy.

   - Allow moments of silence for reflection and contemplation during discussions.
   - Avoid filling every pause with speech.
