## **1. Creation and the Role of Humanity**

### **Hebrew Bible**
The Hebrew Bible begins with the story of creation in Genesis (*Bereshit*), where God creates the universe and designates humanity as stewards of the earth (*Genesis 1:26-28*). This stewardship implies responsibility, care, and the sacredness of all creation.

### **New Testament**
The New Testament reinforces this theme, highlighting humanity's role in manifesting God's kingdom on earth. Paul's writings often emphasize the idea of believers as caretakers of both spiritual and physical creation (*Romans 8:19-22*).

### **Quran**
The Quran echoes these ideas, presenting humanity as *khalifa* (steward) on earth (*Surah Al-Baqarah 2:30*). This stewardship includes caring for the environment, upholding justice, and living in harmony with creation.

- **Shared Insight**: Humanity's divine responsibility to nurture and protect creation is a central theme across all three texts, highlighting a unified call to stewardship.

## **2. The Oneness of God (Monotheism)**

### **Hebrew Bible**
The Shema (*Deuteronomy 6:4*), "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one," serves as the foundation of Jewish monotheism, emphasizing the singularity and sovereignty of God.

### **New Testament**
Jesus reaffirms this in the Gospels, aligning with the Shema and emphasizing the worship of one true God (*Mark 12:29-30*). While the concept of the Trinity is introduced, the focus remains on unity with the Father.

### **Quran**
The Quran places Tawhid (the oneness of God) at its core, repeatedly affirming that there is no deity but Allah (*Surah Al-Ikhlas 112*). This belief defines Islamic theology and practice.

- **Shared Insight**: The oneness of God serves as the cornerstone of all three faiths, fostering a sense of unity and continuity.

## **3. Prophethood and Divine Guidance**

### **Hebrew Bible**
Prophets such as Moses (*Moshe*), Isaiah (*Yeshayahu*), and others are central figures in the Hebrew Bible. They act as messengers who deliver God's laws, guidance, and warnings.

### **New Testament**
The New Testament builds on this tradition, presenting Jesus (*Yeshua*) as both a prophet and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. His teachings and parables provide moral and spiritual guidance.

### **Quran**
The Quran recognizes many shared prophets, including Moses (*Musa*), Jesus (*Isa*), and others, while affirming Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets (*Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40*).

- **Shared Insight**: Prophets serve as intermediaries between God and humanity, emphasizing the importance of divine revelation across all three traditions.

## **4. Justice and Compassion**

### **Hebrew Bible**
Justice is a recurring theme, with commandments focusing on fair treatment of others, care for the vulnerable, and societal equity (*Micah 6:8*). The Torah establishes detailed laws to promote ethical behavior.

### **New Testament**
The New Testament expands this theme, emphasizing compassion and forgiveness. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (*Matthew 5-7*) is a profound call to justice tempered by mercy and humility.

### **Quran**
The Quran balances justice (*Adl*) with mercy (*Rahma*), advocating for fairness in dealings and kindness to the less fortunate (*Surah An-Nisa 4:135*).

- **Shared Insight**: Justice and compassion are universal values that transcend religious boundaries, fostering ethical behavior and societal harmony.

## **5. The Afterlife and Accountability**

### **Hebrew Bible**
The concept of the afterlife is less explicitly developed in the Hebrew Bible but is present in texts like *Daniel 12:2*, which speaks of resurrection and eternal reward or punishment.

### **New Testament**
The New Testament elaborates on this theme, introducing concepts of heaven, hell, and final judgment. Jesus often speaks of the afterlife in parables, emphasizing moral accountability (*Matthew 25:31-46*).

### **Quran**
The Quran vividly describes the Day of Judgment (*Yawm al-Qiyamah*), where every soul is held accountable for its deeds (*Surah Az-Zalzalah 99:6-8*). Paradise and Hell are portrayed as ultimate destinations.

- **Shared Insight**: All three texts underscore the importance of living a righteous life in preparation for divine judgment.

## **6. Sacred Law and Moral Guidance**

### **Hebrew Bible**
The Torah contains a comprehensive legal code that governs every aspect of life, from ritual observance to ethical conduct. The Ten Commandments serve as a summary of these principles (*Exodus 20*).

### **New Testament**
While Jesus often critiques legalism, he upholds the moral essence of the law, summarizing it as love for God and neighbor (*Matthew 22:37-40*).

### **Quran**
The Quran presents Sharia as a holistic framework for life, emphasizing justice, worship, and interpersonal relations (*Surah Al-Baqarah 2:177*).

- **Shared Insight**: Sacred law serves as a guide for living in alignment with divine will, offering a blueprint for personal and communal harmony.
