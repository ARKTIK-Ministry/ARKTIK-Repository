## The Art of Editing

### **1. Narrative Construction**
Editing determines the flow of your story. A skilled editor crafts pacing, tension, and emotional beats that keep the audience invested.

- **Tip**: Start with your storyboards and rough cuts. Identify key moments and ensure each scene transitions smoothly into the next.
- **Exercise**: Re-edit a famous scene to practice pacing and narrative clarity.

### **2. Visual Continuity**
Consistency is critical. Ensure smooth transitions, match shots for lighting and color, and avoid jarring edits that break immersion.

- **Pro Tip**: Use "match-on-action" cuts to maintain continuity between shots. For example, a character opening a door in one shot should appear to complete the action seamlessly in the next.
