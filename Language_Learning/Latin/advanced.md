Advanced Latin texts often use sophisticated literary techniques that require careful study:

Latin authors employ complex syntactical structures to convey subtle meanings:
- **Nested Clauses**:  
  *Ex: Cum omnes, qui aderant, haec verba audivissent, magistratus discessit.*  
  (When all who were present had heard these words, the magistrate left.)
- **Historic Infinitive**: Used for vivid narrative.  
  *Ex: Hostes appropinquare, urbs trepidare, cives se armare.*  
  (The enemy was approaching, the city was trembling, the citizens were arming themselves.)
