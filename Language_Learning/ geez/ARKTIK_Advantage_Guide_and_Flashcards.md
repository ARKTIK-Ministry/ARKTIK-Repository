1. **ä (ə):** Think of “a” in sofa.
2. **u:** Like “oo” in flute.
3. **i:** The “ee” in see.
4. **a:** A bold “a” as in father.
5. **e:** The “e” in bed.
6. **ə:** A neutral sound, echoing **a** in sofa.
7. **o:** The “o” in go.

**Engage:** Practice chanting the vowels while tracing each fidel with a stylized pen for muscle memory.
